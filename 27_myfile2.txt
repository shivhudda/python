As we now have an idea of what files(text or binary) are and 
their access modes, we are now ready to dive into the discussion of file handling 
methods. When we want to read or write a file (say on our hard drive), 
we must first open the file. When we open a file, we are asking the operating 
system to find the file by name, making sure the file exists.
